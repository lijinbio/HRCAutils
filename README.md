Utilities of HRCAutils

1. scarchesh5ad2refbyscanvi: Builds a scArches reference model from a .h5ad file using the scANVI model.

2. scarches2queryannobyscanvi: Predicts cell type labels for a query .h5ad file by referencing a pre-trained scArches model.

These utilities are demonstrated in a short tutorial for constructing the HRCA reference model at https://github.com/RCHENLAB/HRCA_reproducibility/scArches.
